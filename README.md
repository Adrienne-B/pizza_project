# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Pizza Project


## Summary
This was a personal project I wanted to do to practice on the react software. I followed a youtube video which helped me to create
a online pizza website.

### Software used:
Visual Studio Code and react.js

### What I learn:
1. I am understanding the basics of react.js: components, app.js, renders, routers, routers (old version was switch), imports (very important), and
adding a template/background image(not using css for this effect).

2. I learn a short annotation to install and save which is 
 npm react i s


#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
### I understand that any small error will NOT allow the react app to display on the browswer. 
    For this particular projects there were minor issues that caused this problem.
    
1. There was an issue with installing the react-route dom.
2. forgot to import pages and/or components at the top of the App.js.
3. Because I was watching an older react youtube video, Switch was used and not route.
4. Icons 

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. I was You were installing latest version so I change that to version 5 i.e npm i react-router-dom to npm i react-router-dom@^5
2. I have to make sure to import pages and/or components
3. I had to downgrade the version for this project since switch was used. If I had of used routes then I would not have to downgrade the version
4. I had to get the latest version of icons and emotions off of mui website by copying and pasting the latest and importing into App.js


#### Weakness so far:
1.	Still a beginner a react
